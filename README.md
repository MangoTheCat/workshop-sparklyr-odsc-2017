# ODSC 2017 - Sparklyr

This repo has the material from the workshop at ODSC Europe, October 2017

The server we used during the workshop no longer works but the data set will load on a typical laptop. If you follow the installation instructions at [https://spark.rstudio.com/](https://spark.rstudio.com/) then you can setup a local Spark connection and follow the material from that point onward.
