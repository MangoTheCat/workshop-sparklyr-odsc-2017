# ODSC 2017 - Sparklyr

This repo has the material from the workshop at ODSC Europe, October 2017

The slides are [here](SparkAndRWithSparklyr.pdf) and the workshop script [here](sparklyr-workshop.R)

The server we used during the workshop no longer exists but the data set will load on a typical laptop. If you follow the installation instructions at [https://spark.rstudio.com/](https://spark.rstudio.com/) then you can setup a local Spark connection and follow the material from that point onward.

References to the `/workshop` directory should be changed to the data directory from this repo.
